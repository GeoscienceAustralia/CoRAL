# CoRAL - Corner Reflector Analysis Library

CoRAL is a library of tools for analysing the response of corner reflectors (or other targets) in Synthetic Aperture Radar images. The library started as a set of Python scripts developed during corner reflector prototyping experiments at Geoscience Australia. This work, and the implemented algorithms are documented in [Garthwaite 2017](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs9070648).
